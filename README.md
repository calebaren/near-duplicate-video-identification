Near Duplicate Video Identification


This GitHub repository is an implementation of the temporal wavelet transformation algorithm developed by [Rameshnath and Bora](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sandeep_R2/publication/330501710_Perceptual_video_hashing_based_on_temporal_wavelet_transform_and_random_projections_with_application_to_indexing_and_retrieval_of_near-identical_videos/links/5d00741492851c874c5fb26c/Perceptual-video-hashing-based-on-temporal-wavelet-transform-and-random-projections-with-application-to-indexing-and-retrieval-of-near-identical-videos.pdf). The temporal wavelet transformation takes a Haar wavelet transformation along the temporal dimension of a video file and makes use of [Achlioptas' random projection matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_projection#More_computationally_efficient_random_projections) to further reduce dimensionality and generate a perceptual hash.
